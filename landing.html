												<h3>Capstone Project: Fred</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Named after and inspired by Mr. Fred Rogers. Fred is an app to connect strangers with each other and with the idea that motivation and goals can be easier with some support and sometimes that support is easier to take when it's without strings and from a stranger. Mr. Rogers taught us about being good neighbors. Fred gives us a place to put that into practice. Built on a Ruby on Rails backend and VueJs front-end, featuring the Twilio API and a self made chat/messenger feature.</p>

											<p>48 hour HacktheGap work to develop a bra fitting educational website and lingerie 'closet' to help women/non-binary/bra-wearers to feel better in their undergarments and preserve what works for their bodies. Technology built with empathy on a React framework. I brought the initial concept, the product knowledge/content, and acted as project manager.</p>

												<h3>Code Can-Can</h3>
											</header>
											<p>While in DC, I took part in a program called Hear Me Code where women from across the DMV were brought together in a free community program to learn Python. It was eye-opening for me, and ignited an interest in code. I am bringing that content, adding my passion, and starting my own community program called Code Can-Can. If you'd like to help - drop me a line on my contact form.</p>

												<h3>Sailing the seas learning hospitality</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Although I didn't grow up around boats, I find the water to be a happy place, and the adventure of taking boats away from safe harbor challenges me. I learned knots and I learned the rules of the 'road' to drive tenders and steer ships. I learned how to navigate charts, and how to be part of the crew. No job is too small and no job is 'not my job'. Yachting is high stress and high reward.</p>
											<p>From boats, I moved to restaurants where I've managed people, relationships and hospitality at it's finest. I continue to want to provide guests with a great experience, exceed expectations, and to woo. There is so much to be excited about when every guest is an opportunity to sell and represent the quality of our kitchen and our hospitality. </p>

												<h3>Celebrating a major birthday while teaching English in Paradise</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I started teaching English as a volunteer in the Lyndale Neighborhood in South Minneapolis. It was more fulfilling helping people learn English for two hours a week than it was at my 40 hour per week full-time job. I couldn't shake the feeling that the world was better when I could help people, and that I was better when I connected my passion and energy to a higher purpose.</p>
											<p>I completed my TEFL through Hamline University with practical,  in-class teaching experience. I took off soon after to teach English in Santa Cruz, Galapagos, Ecuador where I did a little bit of everything and taught toddlers to adults, and even co-taught a local high school IB English class. I use my teaching skills every day to approach and solve problems, and to connect with a wide swath of people.</p>

										<h2>Outsell: head first into SaaS and selling to car salesmen</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Outsell provided me the material and training to rise through the ranks/roles at a rapidly expanding SaaS email marketing company. I started by managing relationships - retention meetings and trainings - with our dealer clients. I proved to be a genuine and direct communicator able to effectively leverage our product, help our dealer clients find the value, and create relationships.</p>
									<p>From here I moved to high touch and high value pilot programs and association sales. I was able to tell the stories of dealers finding success, and identify business opportunities. I continued to build relationships, telling stories, using empathy and intelligence teach and train. I also brought the dealer stories and use-cases into our internal development process.</p>
									<p>As our pilot programs were effectively sold to key decision makers, and turned into wider sales opportunities, I naturally used my stories and relationships to sell our programs across the country.(find more info on my LinkedIn profile</p>
